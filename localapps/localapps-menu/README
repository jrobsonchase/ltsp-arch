This directory contains all the .desktop and .separator files required
to generate the localapp menu.
The content of this directory should go to /etc/ltsp/localapps-menu/

The directory file contains the menu title.
In the .desktop files you can use the "X-Localapp-Icon" property to specify an
icon file that must be copied to the server (if the icon isn't on the server).
