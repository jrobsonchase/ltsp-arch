Package: ldm
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, LDM_DEPENDS
Architecture: any
Description: LTSP display manager
 ldm is an X11 display manager similar to xdm, gdm and kdm, but unlike
 those it wraps the X11 traffic within an SSH tunnel to provide a
 secure login mechanism for remote X sessions. ldm provides access
 only through SSH, not locally. It is technically possible to use ldm
 to connect to the same host, but probably a waste of CPU power.
 .
 It was written to work with the LTSP project, but should work without
 LTSP as well.
