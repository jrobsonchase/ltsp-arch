ltsp (0.99debian8) unstable; urgency=low

    architecture handling code has been simplified. now all architectures
    default to installing the same architecture running on the server. you
    change change this by passing --arch ARCH to ltsp-build-client, but will
    only work for certain server and ltsp client combinations. see
    /usr/share/doc/ltsp-server/README.Debian for more information.

ltsp (0.99debian6) unstable; urgency=low

    It is now required to set NBD_SWAP=Y instead of setting NBD_PORT in
    /opt/ltsp/ARCH/etc/lts.conf.  Only set NBD_PORT if a non-default value is
    needed. see /usr/share/doc/ltsp-server/swap for more complete
    documentation.
