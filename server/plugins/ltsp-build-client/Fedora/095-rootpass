# FIXME
# Nullify this entire file.  For some reason "/usr/sbin/chroot $ROOT passwd -l root" 
# fails with "Only root can do that." while it succeeds if you run it manually.
# In any case our kickstart file has already disabled root password so we don't
# need this.  It would be nice if somebody figures out the fix for this later though.
