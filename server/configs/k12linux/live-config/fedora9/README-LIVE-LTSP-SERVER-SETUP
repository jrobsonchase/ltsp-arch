Fedora Live LTSP Server 9 Beta 1 README
=======================================
http://k12linux.fedorahosted.org
Please visit our home page for the latest version of these instructions.

This Live image is most useful for two purposes.

  1) Convenient demo of Fedora 9 LTSP without installing anything on your hard 
     drive.  You can boot your server from a USB stick, and after some network 
     configuration you can serve a thin client.

  2) Install a preconfigured LTSP server with client chroot onto a hard drive.
     Use the "Install to Hard Drive" launcher on the Desktop.

The Fedora Live LTSP Server is preconfigured with LTSP services enabled and the
client chroot installed in /opt/ltsp/i386.  By default LTSP services including
a preconfigured DHCP server, NFS server and PXE tftp are served on a virtual 
bridge named ltspbr0.

While LiveDVD is possible, LiveUSB with persitent overlay is recommended because 
it is more efficient in RAM usage.  Be warned that your overlay or ramdisk will
fill up and the demo will fail after a while, so do not rely on this Live image
for production services.  For production please install it onto a real hard drive.

Setup Instructions
==================
The instructions assume that you have two network cards, or one wireless + one
card network.  One interface (either wired or wireless) is for accessing the Internet
on your normal network.  The other interface is dedicated to serving an isolated 
network segment for thin clients.  Other methods of configuration like 
"Single Network Card" are more advanced and  will require manual configuration
beyond the scope of this README.  Please see the project homepage or ask on our
mailing list for more information about other ways to configure networking.

WARNING: ltspbr0 has a DHCP server running on it.  Be especially careful that 
you do not attach your Internet facing network interface to ltspbr0 or you 
can cause serious problems for your network.

1) Upon booting the Fedora Live LTSP Server, NetworkManager has control over all 
network interfaces.  This can be good if one Ethernet port has Internet access or
if you want the wireless to connect to the Internet.  After logging into the Live 
desktop, the NetworkManager icon in the top right panel will tell you if it already
connected to the Internet and through which interface.  If you have wireless, you
can use this interface to connect to a wireless network at this time.  

2) We need to edit the configuration so NetworkManager no longer controls the desired
LTSP serving Ethernet interface.  Then this interface can be used to serve your LTSP
network segment.

3) Run 'system-config-network'
4) Click "New"
5) Select the desired Ethernet card to serve your isolated LTSP network segment.
     Be absolutely sure that this interface is NOT the one currently in use 
     connected to the Internet.  You can click on the NetworkManager icon to 
     verify which interface is currently in use.
6) Select "Statically set IP addresses:"
   DO NOT FILL OUT ANYTHING IN THESE FIELDS.
   Click Forward.
   Click Apply.
7) Edit the interface again.
   Verify that "Controlled by NetworkManager" is unchecked.
   Click OK.
   Close system-config-network.
8) As root, edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX.  ethX will be
     interface you just configured in these previous steps.
9) Add the following line at the bottom of this file:
   BRIDGE=ltspbr0
   Save and exit.
10) As root:
   ifdown ethX
   ifup ethX
11) As root:
   brctl show
     This command can verify that this ethX interface is attached to the ltspbr0 bridge.
12) luseradd testuser
    passwd testuser
    This creates and sets the password for a non-root user, so you can test your first login.
13) rm /etc/skel/Desktop/README-LTSP-SERVER-SETUP
    If you have installed this onto your hard drive, you probably want to remove 
      this README file from all user desktops.

At this point that Ethernet interface should be serving PXE network bootable clients.
If it does not work, then please ask for help on k12linux-devel-list.
