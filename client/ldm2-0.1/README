ldm2 is the C translation of the python based LTSP Display Manager

Currently, it doesn't interface with a greeter, as this design will require a 
conversation with the greeter, rather than a simple "get name and password"
of the existing greeter.

Work on the greeter will also be done.

For now, as a substitute, I'm using Xdialog to interface with the user.

If you'd like to play with ldm2, here's the steps.

1) Get the branch (you've obviously done this already)
2) Build ldm2 (standard ./configure && make)
3) Copy ldm2 to $CHROOT/usr/bin
4) Modify $CHROOT/usr/lib/ltsp/screen.d/ldm.  Change the call to ldm to ldm2.
   The command line parameters of ldm2 are the same.
5) Install Xdialog in the chroot.  Add the Universe repository to the 
   $CHROOT/etc/apt/sources.list, and apt-get install xdialog.

Currently, LOTS of things won't work.  I've renamed the command socket for
ldm to /tmp/.ldmsocket, so we'll need to patch up the udev scripts for localdev.
Plus, I'm not yet setting all the env variables needed, etc etc etc.

However, LDM_DIRECTX works!

As well, cool way was discovered for setting the DISPLAY variable based on the
SSH_CLIENT variable:


DISPLAY=${SSH_CLIENT%% *}:dpy#

I'd just like to say I'm quite proud of that.

Lots more work to do, but a VERY encouraging start.

KEEP WATCHING THE SKIES^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HTHIS SPACE!
