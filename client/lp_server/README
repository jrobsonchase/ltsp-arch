This program allows you to 'export' a printer on your local host
to be used by an LPRng spooler.  It is basically simulating an
HP JetDirect interface,  which opens a connection on port 9100
and simply dumps input to the PostScript Engine.

lp_server [-n port] [-t stty_options] [-d device]

   -n  port - listen (bind) to this port for incoming connections
   -d   device  - the device to open
   -t  stty_options - a list of stty options, similar (i.e.- identical)
       to those used by other filters supplied with LPRng.
